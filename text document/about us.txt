About us
Who are we
Pads for All is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing essential menstrual products to schools and communities in rural areas. With its head office in Sandton South Africa Pads for All has been committed to addressing period poverty for over 10 years. The name "Pads for All" reflects our mission to ensure that every girl and woman has access to the menstrual products they need. From our modest beginnings in Sandton, Johannesburg, we have expanded our reach to support communities across South Africa and beyond. Today our efforts span over 3 countries, where we work tirelessly to provide support and relief to those most vulnerable, ensuring that menstruation never hinders a girl's education or quality of life.


Social welfare
Pads for All is dedicated to improving the well-being of communities by providing essential menstrual products and support. In addition to our core mission of distributing pads to schools and rural communities, we extend our care to vulnerable groups, including homes for the elderly and children's homes. Our goal is to uplift and enhance the quality of life within our communities, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their circumstances, has access to the resources they need to thrive. By addressing period poverty and supporting social care initiatives, Pads for All is committed to making our communities better places for all.
